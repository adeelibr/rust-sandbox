### The standard beginning with hello world

Steps:

- Make a file called hello.rs
- Have a function called main
- Inside main console `Hello world`

You will have to use `println!` (the exclamation mark `!` is used to invoke the println macro)

- Once the function is written, in your terminal type

```code
$ rustc hello.rs
```

This will create a `hello` file in the same directory. Which is basically an executabnle
file & can be simple run in your terminal.

```code
$ ./hello
```
